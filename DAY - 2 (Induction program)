# INDUCTION PROGRAM
## DAY - 2 
The day was thoughtfully planned to help first-year students build strong values, assess their skills, and explore growth opportunities. It began with a series of expert talks that provided valuable guidance for both personal and academic development.

👩‍🏫 Dr. Priya Darshni delivered a session on “Universal Human Values – 1”, encouraging students to understand the importance of empathy, respect, and responsibility in everyday life.
Dr. Arvind Dhingra introduced college initiatives like STEP and TAC, which are designed to support student development beyond the classroom, through workshops, projects, and soft skills training.
Dr. Arashdeep Singh gave an insightful talk on the role of nutrition in student life, explaining how food choices can greatly impact mental and physical well-being.

📝 To understand the students’ academic readiness, English and Maths proficiency tests were conducted for all streams. These assessments help identify areas where students may need additional support, ensuring a strong academic foundation.

🎓 The day also included a session by the Buddy4Study team, who guided students through various scholarship opportunities available for first-year students. This helped students become aware of financial aid options that can ease their educational journey.

Overall, the day was engaging, informative, and aimed at holistic student development.
